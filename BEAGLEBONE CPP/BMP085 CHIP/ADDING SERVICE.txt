 Running a script on Beaglebone Black boot/ startup
1. Compile the required code.

2. Create a bash script that will launch the code at boot/ startup

    cd /usr/bin/

Type nano <scriptname.sh>

    #!/bin/bash
    /home/root/<name_of_compiled_code>


Save and grant execute permission

    chmod u+x /usr/bin/<scriptname>.sh

3. Create the service

     nano /lib/systemd/<scriptname>.service

4. Edit the above file as necessary to invoke the different functionalities like network. Enable these only if the code needs that particular service. Disable unwanted ones to decrease boot time.

    [Unit]
    Description=Reverse SSH Service
    ConditionPathExists=|/usr/bin
    After=network.target
     
    [Service]
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/wall "Hello world!"
    Restart=always
    RestartSec=10
    StartLimitInterval=0
     
    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target


 5.  Create a symbolic link to let the device know the location of the service.

    cd /etc/systemd/system/
    ln /lib/systemd/<scriptname>.service <scriptname>.service


6. Make systemd reload the configuration file, start the service immediately (helps to see if the service is functioning properly) and enable the unit files specified in the command line.

    systemctl daemon-reload
    systemctl start <scriptname>.service
    systemctl enable <scriptname>.service


7. Restart BBB immediately to see if it runs as intended.

    shutdown -r now

8. Check status

    systemctl status myservice.service
    systemctl start myservice.service
    systemctl stop myservice.service
